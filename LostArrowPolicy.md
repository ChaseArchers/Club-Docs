# LOST ARROW AND EQUIPMENT PROCEDURES

If an arrow or any related item of equipment (tie down pegs, target pins, arrow
points etc.) is lost them the following must be adhered to at ALL times:

- Upon the loss of an arrow the archer must look for it with the help of other
archers for the next 2 ends of shooting. (Metal detector is in the cabin)

- If after 2 ends it has not been found then ALL shooting is to stop and ALL
archers are to assist in the search.

- If after 15 minutes the item has not been found then shooting may recommence
and the lost arrow register must be completed with the assistance of the field
captain. (Lost arrow book in Cabin)

- The field captain has the final decision to say when shooting may recommence.

- Searching will continue after each end until the end of the session.

- Archers are to ensure that they know the type of arrow with colour of fletching
and what distance was being shot etc. which is to be noted in the register.  

- The field captain and club secretary are responsible for passing on the information
to the school as soon as possible after the loss.

- It is the loserâ€™s responsibility to ensure that all reasonable steps are taken
to find the lost item.

- When in use All-Carbon Arrows must follow the All-Carbon Arrow policy.
