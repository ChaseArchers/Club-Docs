# SAFETY

1. Do not proceed beyond the shooting line until all shooting has been completed
and the signal (a whistle blow) has been given.

2. Do not commence shooting until all others present are behind the waiting line
and a signal (one blast on a whistle) has been given.

3. When outside stand behind the waiting line (5 yard line) when not shooting.

4. Do not load or draw a bow when not at the shooting line.

5. A safe method of shooting must be observed such as not drawing the bow above
the level of the target.

6. Under no circumstances should an arrow be shot into the air, unless on a Clout
shoot.

7. When you have finished shooting move away from the shooting line taking into
consideration neighbouring archers and wait until you hear two or three blasts
of the whistle before you collect your arrows.

8. Do not run or fool around on the shooting range. Those failing to observe
these safety rules will be asked to leave. Any participant or member of the public
whose behaviour disrupts the activity or poses a danger will be asked to leave.
If such a person refuses to cooperate then all archery activity will be suspended.

9. If you hear the word fast or stop or a series of whistles then do not shoot
and tell everyone around you to stop shooting, and then remove any arrow that may
be nocked onto your bow string.

10. If you see any danger, immediately shout Stop or Fast and let the Target
Captain know the danger and all other archers.

11. Listen carefully to your Target Captain, they are there to help you. If you
are in any way unsure about anything ask.

12. If you have a medical condition which may be aggravated by shooting your bow
then tell your coach. Archery should not be a painful sport, if it becomes so then
stop.

13. Every effort must be made to find all lost arrows. If they are not found, the
fact of their disappearance must be noted along with the rough position that they
are believed to be. The lost arrow must be reported to a member of the committee
and the school informed.
