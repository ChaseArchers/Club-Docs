# Outdoor All Carbon Arrows Policy

1. Archers must have at least 12 months experience before they may use all-carbon
arrows outdoors.
2. Archers must notify the committee that they intend to utilise all-carbon arrows
before they use them (it is advisable that this is discussed before purchasing).
3. Lost arrow procedures must be strictly adhered to.
4. It is the responsibility of the archer to ensure that lost and damaged arrow
procedures and all-carbon rules are followed.
5. At least some portion of the arrow must be detectable by a metal detector
(points, bushings, pins, etc.).
6. All-carbon arrows may only be used on full size target bosses (those designed
for a full size 122cm target face). No 3D targets, small bosses, target bags,
clout, etc.
7. Target faces must be centred on the boss when all-carbon arrows are in use
(no using paired/quad faces or offsetting the face).
8. Any all-carbon arrows must carry the archer's initials or preferably name and
be uniquely numbered.
9. When finding sightmarks archers are not to shoot a distance more than 20m away
from another known sightmark or start from 20yds/18m. It is recommended to ask
another archer to spot for you.
10. For each bowstyle archers may not shoot further than the next 252 distance
from their highest complete 252 distance or the highest metric equivalent below
that distance.
11. Competition/ROM scores may be used in place of the 252 advancement, the
committee will calculate the maximum distance allowed based on the rounds and
handicaps submitted. Further advancement can be via 252 or new competition scores.
12. The committee may revoke all-carbon privileges or limit their maximum allowed
distance beyond the 252 rule above, for example if an archer has had a few years
break or uses a higher than normal draw. This decision is entirely at the discretion
of the committee.
13. Any damaged all-carbon arrows must be reported to the line captain of the session
to ensure that shards or splinters are accounted for.
14. Extra caution is to be taken when performing bow tuning with all-carbon arrows,
for example it may be necessary to place several bosses adjacent to each other to
form a larger capture zone, or for running to start at extremely close distance.
15. Damaged or broken carbon arrows are to have splinters secured by wrapping
splintered sections in masking tape, any loose shards should be wrapped and taped
in paper.
16. Damaged or broken carbon arrows are to be disposed of by the archer at home,
not at the venue.
17. Failure to follow these rules may result in the revocation of all-carbon
privileges or suspension of membership.
