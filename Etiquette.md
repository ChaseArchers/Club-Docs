# CLUB ETIQUETTE

A GOOD ARCHER:

- Does not talk in a loud voice whilst others are shooting.

- Does not talk to another who obviously prefers to be silent

- Does not make exclamations on the shooting line which might disconcert a neighbour
in the act of shooting.

- Does not walk up and down the shooting line comparing scores.

- Does not go behind the target before their scores have been recorded.

- When calling scores does so in groups of three e.g. 9-9-7 pause 5-5-3

- Does not touch anyone else's equipment without permission.

- If any person should break any part of an archerâ€™s equipment then they should pay
for those item/s, except accidental damage caused to arrows in normal shooting.

- Thank the Target/Field  Captain at the end of a round

- Will make sure they do not leave litter behind on their clubs ground or when
visiting other grounds.

- Will not leave footmarks or pins from target faces on the field as these will
cause damage to the grass cutter.

- Should always help set up targets and backstop netting.

- Is expected to take their share of Club chores when they are asked to do so.

- Is expected to wear green and white (traditional GNAS) or club colours at tournaments
or club shoots.

- Whilst not shooting archers must retire at least 5 yards from the shooting line
when shooting outdoors.

- Takes extra care not to mark the turf. Foot markers can be used but the scoring
of the grass must be avoid.
